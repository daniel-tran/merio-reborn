# merio-reborn
A short, simple platformer computer game made in my spare time. Made using Game Maker 8.1 Lite Edition.

Now, I know what you're thinking:

Q. Will the source code ever be uploaded?

A. Not really.
   Because "MERIO Reborn" is a sequel from the first game, it builds on the initial source code which was developed by someone else.
   I would have to get in touch with said person for confirmation that some of their code will be publicly available.
   Even so, the source code is stored in a .gmk file, requiring you to install Game Maker in order to view and execute the code.
